I've only started learning AngularJS/NodeJS a few months ago.
I thought it would be pretty neat to use AngularJS for this app.
I used bootstrap to help with styling and responsiveness.
I used yeoman, bower, and grunt to help wiht the development.
ChartJS and talking to the scoped data within angularJS was tricky but was able to figure that out. (though I feel there is a better way to do it than what i've implemented).
I learned some new nuances about angular that I wasnt aware of before. such as the factory calls being deffered.
I tried to use the SASS version of bootstrap but I wasn't able to get that configured properly (never worked with less or sass before).

The main files I worked with are:
index.html
main.html
main.js
users.js
logs.js
main.css
